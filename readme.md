- skeleton files (i.e. skeleton.*) 
  - saved here: /.vim/templates/skeletons/
  - symlinks are here: /Users/brandongoldney/.vim/after/ftplugin

- *.vim 
  - saved in .config/formatting and used to update formatting. Including the formatting in .vimrc does not work becaue it is overriden by
  plug-ins.
