- skeleton files (i.e. skeleton.*) 
  - saved here: /.vim/templates/skeletons/
  - the skeleton files are symlinked in this .config directory

- cpp.vim and html.vim 
  - saved in .config and used to update formatting. Including the formatting in .vimrc does not work becaue it is overriden by
  plug-ins.
